This Jupyter notebook primarily focuses on the implementation of Unet model and its application from scratch on the Image Segmentation problem. Training was performed usin the CWFID dataset and In the 'Image Classification with U-Net' folder, Unet model was applied on image segmentation with the CWFID dataset. Given the limited size of the CWFID dataset, this experiment is tried to enhance performance through Transfer Learning. To achieve this, I defined a classification model that is identical to the first half of the Unet model. This model was trained on the 'Deep Weeds' dataset using cross-entropy loss.
Following that, I fine-tuned the U-Net model using the CWFID dataset. During this fine-tuning process, all layers were kept frozen with pretrained weights, and only the second half of the model were trained, finally fine-tuned the entire model on the CWFID dataset.
