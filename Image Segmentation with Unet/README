This Jupyter notebook primarily focuses on the implementation of Unet model and its application from scratch on the Image Segmentation problem. Training was performed using the CWFID dataset and they are visualized on the session of Load Data. However, due to computational constraints, the model was trained on a small size dataset and for a limited number of epochs.
