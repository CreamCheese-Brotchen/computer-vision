This Jupyter notebook primarily focuses on the implementation of BiT model and its application to the Image Classification problem. The model was trained on the dataset "is-that-santa" from Kaggle. The preprocessing pipeline encompasses the selection of image size and dataset size, defining training steps and scheduling, and so on.  The experiment evaluates the model's performance across various scenarios, including training for 10 epochs, 30 epochs, applying image rotation for 10 epochs, and employing grayscale images for 10 epochs.
